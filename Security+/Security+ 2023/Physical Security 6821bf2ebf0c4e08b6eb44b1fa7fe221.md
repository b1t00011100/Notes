# Physical Security

### Introduction

- If an attacker can physically touch your devices, they can own your devices.
- **Physical Security** is divided in 3 different areas :
    - **Perimeter**
    - **Building**
    - **Room**
    

### Surveillance

- **CCTV** : **C**losed **C**ircuit **TV**
    - Wired : The cameras are wired to a central monitoring system.
    - Wireless : Cameras are networked wirelessly
- **PTZ** : **P**an **T**ilt **Z**oom - Camera that can be controlled by a joystick.
- **Ultrasonic** : Used for sound based detection.

### Door Locks

- **Door Locks** can use keys, pins, wireless signals, or biometrics.
- **Basic Office Door Lock** : Easy to open minimum security.
- **Cipher Locks** : Provides excellent protection using a mechanical locking mechanism with push buttons.
- **Electronic Access Control Systems** : These use a RFID reader to scan an employees badge and grant them access based on credentials.
- **Mantrap** : Area between two doorways that hold people until they are identified and authenticated.
    - There are placed at entrance of buildings with a set of turnstiles.

### Biometric Readers

- Relies on the physical characteristics of a person to identify them.
- **False Acceptance Rate (FAR) :** Rate that a system authenticates a user as authorized or valid when they should not have been granted access to the system.
- **False Rejection Rate (FRR) :** Rate that a system denies a user as authorized or valid when they should have been granted access to the system.
- **Crossover Error Rate (CER) :** An equal error rate (ERR) where the false acceptance rate and false rejection rate are equal.
- **CER** measures the effectiveness of Biometric system.
