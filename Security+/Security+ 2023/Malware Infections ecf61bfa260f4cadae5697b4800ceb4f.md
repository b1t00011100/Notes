# Malware Infections

- **Threat Vector :** Method used by an attacker to access a victim’s machine.
    - Examples : Unpatched Software , Installation from a thumb drive , Phishing Campaign.
- **Attack Vector :** Method used by an attacker to gain access to victim’s machine in order to affect it with malware.

### Common Delivery Methods

- Malware infections usually start within software, messaging and media.
    - Messaging : email.
    - Software : peer to peer like bit-torrent.
    - media : Thumb drive.
- **Watering Hole :** Malware is placed on a website that you know your potential victims will access.
- **Automated toolkit called as Exploit kit that this really easy as an attacker.**
- **Typo squatting :** Clone Websites of legit websites that contains malware.

- **Botnets  :** A collection of compromised computers under the control of a master node.
    - **Zombie :** Computers which have been compromised
    - Botnets can be utilized in other processor intensive functions and activities.
    - DDoS attacks
    - Crypto Mining

- **Active Interception :** Placed between the sender and receiver and captures and modifies traffic.
- **Privilege Escalation :** Exploiting a design flaw or bug in a system to gain resources that a normal user cant access.

### Backdoors and Logic Bombs

- Backdoors are used to bypass normal security and authentication functions.
- Remote Access Trojan is places by an attacker to maintain persistent access.
- **Easter Eggs :** Non-malicious code that when invoked, displays an insider joke, hidden message or secret feature.
- **Logic Bomb :** Malicious code that has been inserted inside a program and will execute only when certain conditions are met.
- Logic bombs and Easter eggs should not be used according to secure coding standards

### Symptoms of Injections

- If it starts acting strangely
- Computer starts locking up or stops responding frequently
- Computer crashes or restarts randomly
- Hard drives , files and applications are not accessible anymore
- Strange noises occur
- Unusual error messages
- Display looks strange
- Jumbled printouts
- icons appear or disappear on desktop
- Double file extensions are being displayed such as textfile.txt.exe
- Antivirus wont run
- New files/folders are created or missing/corrupted
- System restore function will not function.

### Removing Malware

- Backup of our current system
- Steps for Removing malware
    1. Identify symptoms of a malware infection 
    2. Quarantine the infected machine/systems
    3. Disable system restore (Only when Windows machine)
    4. Remediate the infected system
    5. Schedule automatic updates and scans
    6. Enable system restore and create a new restore point
    7. Provide end user security awareness training

### Preventing Malware

- Good host based firewall
- Getting all the updates to patch exploits
- Worms, Trojans and Ransomware are best detected with anti-malware solutions
- Scanners can detect a file containing a rootkit before it is installed , removal of a rootkit is difficult and the best plan is to reimage the machine
- Educate and train end users on safe internet surfing practices

### Malware Exploitation

- **Exploit Technique** : Describes the specific method by which malware code infects a target host.
- Most modern malware uses fileless techniques to avoid detection by signature-based security software.
- **Dropper** : Malware designed to install or run other types of malware embedded in a payload on an infected host.
- **Downloader** : A piece of code that connects to the internet to retrieve additional tools after the initial infection by a dropper.
- **Shellcode** : An lightweight code designed to run an exploit on the target, which may include any type of code format from scripting languages to binary code.
- **Code Injection** :  Exploit technique that runs malicious code with the identification number of a legitimate process
- **Living off the land** : Exploit techniques that use standard system tools and packages to perform intrusions
