# Risk Assessments

### Risk Assessments

- A process used inside of risk management to identify how much risk exists in a given network or system.
- **Risk** : The probability that a threat will be realized.
- **Vulnerability** : Weakness in the design or implementation of a system.
- **Threat** : Any condition that could cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to our information technology systems.
- Threats are external and beyond your control.
- Risk management is used to minimize the likelihood of a negative outcome from occurring.
- Things to do with risks
    - Avoid - **Risk Avoidance** : A strategy that requires stopping the activity that has risk or choosing a less risky alternative.
    - Transfer - **Risk Transfer** : A strategy that passes the risk to a third party.
    - Mitigate - **Risk Mitigation** : A strategy that seeks to minimize the risk to an acceptable level.
    - Accept - **Risk Acceptance** : A strategy that seeks to accept the current level of risk and the costs associated with it if the risk were realized.
    - **Residual Risk** : The risk remaining after trying to avoid, transfer, or mitigate the risk.

### Qualitative Risk

- **Qualitative analysis** uses intuition, experience and other methods to assign a relative value to risk.
    - Experience is critical in qualitative risk.

### Quantitative Risk

- **Quantitative analysis** uses numerical and monetary values to calculate risk.
    - Quantitative analysis can a calculate a direct cost for each risk.
- **Magnitude of Impact** : An estimation of the amount of damage that a negative risk might achieve.
    - **Single Loss Expectancy(SLE) :** Cost associated with the realization of each individualized threat that occurs.
        
        > Asset Value X Exposure Factor
        > 
    - **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) :** Number of times per year that a threat is realized.
    - **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) :** Expectancy cost of a realized threat over a given year.
        
        > ALE = SLE X ARO
        > 
- Hybrid approaches that combine quantitative and qualitative analysis are commonly used.

### Methodologies

- **Security Assessments :** Verify that the organization’s security posture is designed and configured properly to help thwart different types of attacks.
- Assessments might be required by contracts, regulation or laws.
- Assessments can be active or passive
    - **Active Assessments :** Utilized more intrusive techniques like scanning, hands-on testing, and probing of the network to determine vulnerabilities.
    - **Passive Assessments** : Utilize open source information, the passive collection and analysis of the network data, and other unobtrusive methods without making direct contact with the targeted systems.

### Security Controls

- **Security Controls** : Methods implemented to mitigate a particular risk.
- Security Control are categorized as **physical**, **technical**, and **administrative**.
    - **Physical Controls** : Any security measure that are designed to deter or prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or the systems that contain it.
    - **Technical Controls :** Safeguards and countermeasures used to avoid, detect, counteract or minimize  security risks to our systems and information.
    - **Administrative Controls** : Focused on changing the behavior of people instead of removing the actual risk involved.

### Types of Risk

- **External Risk :** Risks that are produced by a non-human source and are beyond human control.
- **Internal Risk :** Risks that are formed within an organization.
- **Legacy Systems :** An old method, technology, computer system, or application program which includes an outdated computer system still in use.
- **Multiparty :** A risk that refers to the connection of multiple systems or organizations with each bringing their own inherent risks.
- **IP theft :** Risk associated with business assets and property being stolen from an organization in which economic damage, the loss of a competitive edge, or a showdown in business growth occurs.
- **Software compliance and licensing :** Risk associated with a company not being aware of what software or components are installed within its network.
