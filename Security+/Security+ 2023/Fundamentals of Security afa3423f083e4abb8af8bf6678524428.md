1. What is Security?

Security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or destruction. The goal is to ensure data remains safe and reliable.

2. CIA Triad

The core principles of information security:

Confidentiality – Prevents unauthorized access to data
Examples: encryption, access control, authentication

Integrity – Ensures data is accurate and unaltered
Examples: hashing, checksums, digital signatures

Availability – Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed
Examples: redundancy, backups, load balancing

3. Authentication, Authorization & Accounting (AAA)

Authentication – Verifying identity (passwords, biometrics, MFA)

Authorization – Granting access rights (roles, permissions)

Accounting – Logging and monitoring user actions

4. Least Privilege

Users and systems should be given only the minimum access required to perform their tasks, reducing the impact of compromise.

5. Defense in Depth

Uses multiple layers of security controls so if one layer fails, others still protect the system.
Example: firewall + IDS + endpoint protection + logging.

6. Risk, Threat, and Vulnerability

Threat – A potential cause of harm (malware, attacker)

Vulnerability – A weakness that can be exploited

Risk – Likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

7. Types of Security Controls

Preventive – Stop attacks (firewalls, access control)

Detective – Identify incidents (IDS, logs)

Corrective – Fix issues (patching, backups)

Deterrent – Discourage attacks (warning banners)

8. Physical, Administrative & Technical Security

Physical – Locks, CCTV, biometrics

Administrative – Policies, procedures, training

Technical – Firewalls, encryption, antivirus

9. Importance of Security

Security protects:

Sensitive data

Business continuity

User trust

Legal and regulatory compliance
