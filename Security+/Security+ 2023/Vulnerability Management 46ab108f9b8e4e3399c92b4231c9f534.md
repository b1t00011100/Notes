# Vulnerability Management

### Introduction

- **Vulnerability Assessment :** Seeks to identify any issues in a network, application, database, or other systems prior to it being used that might compromise the system.
    - Defines, identifies and classifies vulnerabilities within a system.
- **Vulnerability Management :** Practice of finding and mitigating the vulnerabilities in computers and networks.
- Nessus, Qualysguard and AlienVault are used for vulnerability assessments.
- Process of **Vulnerability Management** in 5 steps :
    1. Define the desired state of security.
    2. Create a Baseline.
    3. Prioritize the Vulnerabilities.
    4. Mitigate Vulnerabilities.
    5. Monitor the network and systems.
- **Scan - Patch - Scan.**

### Penetration Testing

- **Penetration testing :** A test that uses active tools and security utilities to evaluate security by simulating an attack on a system to verify that a threat exists, actively test it, bypass security controls, and then finally exploit vulnerabilities on a given system.
- Penetration tests look at a network’s vulnerabilities from the outside.
    - **Black-Box Testing** : Zero Knowledge
    - **Gray-Box Testing** : Some Knowledge
    - **White-Box Testing** : Full Knowledge
- **Metasploit** and **CANVAS** are commonly used.
- **Penetration Test** carry 5 basic steps :
    1. Get permission and document info
    2. Conduct reconnaissance
    3. Enumerate the targets
    4. Exploit the targets
    5. Document the results
- **Pivot :** Occurs when an attacker moves onto another workstation or user account.
- **Persistence** : Ability of an attacker to maintain a foothold inside the compromised network.
- A pentester can also simulate an insider threat.

### Training & Exercises

- **Tabletop Exercises :** Exercises that uses an incident scenario against a framework of controls or a red team.
    - A tabletop exercise is a discussion of simulated emergency situations and security incidents.
- **Penetration testing :** A test that uses active tools and security utilities to evaluate security by simulating an attack on a system to verify that a threat exists, actively test it, bypass security controls, and then finally exploit vulnerabilities on a given system.
    - A pentest must be properly scoped and resourced before it can begin.
- **Red/Blue/White exercises -**
    - **Red Team** : The hostile or attacking team in a penetration test or incident response exercise.
    - **Blue Team** : The Defensive team in a penetration test or incident response exercise.
    - **White Team** : The Staff that does the administering,evaluating and Supervising a penetration test or incident response exercise.

### OVAL

- **Open Vulnerability and Assemble Language :** A Standard designed to regulate the transfer of secure public information across the network and the internet utilising every network tool and services available.
- **OVAL** is comprised of a language and an interpreter.
- **OVAL** **Language**: An XML schema used to define and describe the information created by OVAL
- **OVAL Interpreter :** A reference developed to ensure the information passed around by these programs complies with the OVAL schemas and definitions used by the OVAL Language.

### Vulnerability Assessment

- **Vulnerability Assessment :** Baselining of the network to assess the current security state of computers, servers, network devices and the entire network in general.
- Types of Tools that are used to conduct these assessments
    - **Network Mapping :** Discovery and Documentation of physical and logical connectivity that exists in the network.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning :** A technique that identifies threats on the network without exploiting them.
        - **Banner Grabbing :** A technique used to gain information about servers and inventory the systems or services.
    - **Network Sniffing :** The process of finding and investigating other computers on the network by analyzing the network traffic or capturing the packets being sent.
        - Network sniffer, packet sniffing and protocol analyzer can all conduct packet capture.
        - **Protocol Analyzer :** Software tool that allows for the capture, reassembly and analysis of packets from the network.
    - **Password Analysis**

### Password Analysis

- **Password Analysis** : A tool used to test the strength of your passwords to ensure your password policies are being followed.
- **Password Cracker** : Uses comparative analysis to break passwords and systematically continues guessing until the password is determined.
    - Cain & Abel and John the ripper are two commonly used password cracker.
- **Password Guessing** : Occurs when a weak password is simply figured out by a person.
- **Dictionary Attack :** Method where a program attempts to guess the password by using a list of possible passwords.
- **Brute-Force Attack** : Method where a program attempts to try every single possible combination until it cracks the password.
    - Increasing complexity exponentially increases the time required to brute-force a password.
- **Cryptanalysis Attack** : Comparing a precomputed encrypted password to a value in a lookup table.
    - **Rainbow Table** : List of precomputed valued used to more quickly break a password since values don’t have to be calculated for each password being guessed.
- **Rubber Hose Attack** : Attempt to crack a password by threating or causing a person physical harm in order to make them tell you the password.
